		bio: `**Hi, I’m Nirmesh and I’m a Full-Stack engineer turned founder, with over a decade of hands-on experience building high-impact software products across startups and enterprises.**

**I’ve architected systems end-to-end from frontend interfaces and backend APIs to scalable cloud deployments and resilient microservices. My toolkit spans React, Next.js, Node.js, Go, Python, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Docker, AWS.**

**I’ve built AI-driven platforms, real-time apps, and enterprise SaaS tools serving thousands of users. I’ve led engineering teams, handled complex migrations, and shipped products that scale.**

**Today, as the Founder & CTO of QuickDIV, I help businesses turn ambitious ideas into well-engineered realities. Whether it’s launching an MVP, optimizing performance, or providing strategic tech leadership – I bridge the gap between product vision and solid execution.**

**What motivates me most is seeing ideas come to life the right way: thoughtfully built, future-ready, and genuinely valuable.**

**If you're looking for someone who can think like a founder and build like a senior engineer – let’s connect.**`,
